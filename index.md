Example results of deploying `gha-utilities/ai-bait` GitHub Action via Jekyll
powered Pages.  Check the [main](https://github.com/gha-utilities/ai-bait)
branch for additional documentation and GitHub Action's source code.

The `.zip` file created by this GitHub Action may be downloaded via
<a href="assets/ai/bait.zip" nofollow>assets/ai/bait.zip</a>, which _should_
decompress to a much larger file full of zero value bytes ;-D
