## Notes
[heading__notes]:
  #notes
  "&#x1F5D2; Additional things to keep in mind when developing"


This repository may not be feature complete and/or fully functional, Pull
Requests that add features or fix bugs are certainly welcomed.

To prevent causing issues with legitimate/authorized web-scrapers, and other
tools, be sure to keep your site's `robots.txt` up to date!  Simplest option is
to tell all robots not to access the file(s) generated by AI Bait;

```
User-agent: *
Disallow: /assets/ai/bait.zip
```

To prevent duplicate deployments caused by default `gh-pages` branch behavior,
be sure to update the repository Settings → Pages → GitHub Pages → Build and
deployment → Source configuration to use "GitHub Actions"

> `https://github.com/<ACCOUNT>/<REPO>/settings/pages`

  #forking
  "&#x1F531; Tips for forking AI Bait"


Start making a [Fork][honeybot__fork_it] of this repository to an account that
you have write permissions for.


- Add remote for fork URL. The URL syntax is
  _`git@github.com:<NAME>/<REPO>.git`_...


```Bash
cd ~/git/hub/gha-utilities/ai-bait

git remote add fork git@github.com:<NAME>/ai-bait.git
```


- Commit your changes and push to your fork, eg. to fix an issue...

> Note, the `-u` option may be used to set `fork` as the default remote, eg.
> _`git push -u fork main`_ however, this will also default the `fork` remote
